# AMP-Operating-System

The Aspen Multi-Platform Operating System, Built by the Aspen Software Foundation.

This Operating System was made to fix the problem of Windows' files (.exe, .dll, .pe, etc.) being incompatible with Unix/Linux-like Operating systems (including Unix and Linux).
Have fun digging through everything. Stay safe, stay Aspen.
