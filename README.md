# AMP-Operating-System

The Aspen Multi-Platform Operating System, Built by the Aspen Software Foundation.

This Operating System was made to fix the problem of Windows' files (.exe, .dll, .pe, etc.) being incompatible with Unix/Linux-like Operating systems (including Unix and Linux).
This folder is meant to give documentation on how this Operating System works inside and out.
Have fun digging through everything. Stay safe, stay Aspen.
