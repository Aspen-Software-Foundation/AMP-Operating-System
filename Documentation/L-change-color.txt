The Aspen Multi-Platform Operating System supports colored text output on the console using ANSI escape sequences. This lets you display messages with colors for better readability â€” for example, highlighting errors in red or information in white.
This document explains how to use and modify the existing colored text mechanism in the source code.

How Colored Text Works:
The console uses ANSI escape codes embedded in strings to change text color. The escape codes are sent as part of formatted output to the console framebuffer.

This is how to change the color of a string of text:

console.printf("{s}{s}Colored Text{s}", .{ CSI, COLOR, RESET });
                                           ^^^  ^^^^^  ^^^^^ 
The "{s}" is for a string argument, as seen here ^

You can also add a custom color code by choosing from the options below, and putting them into the "COLOR" argument. For example: ".{CSI, RED, RESET}"


ANSI Color Codes (included):

const BLACK = "30m";
const RED = "31m";
const GREEN = "32m";
const YELLOW = "33m";
const BLUE = "34m";
const MAGENTA = "35m";
const CYAN = "36m";
const WHITE = "37m";

Background:
const BLACK_BG = "40m";
const RED_BG = "41m";
const GREEN_BG = "42m";
const YELLOW_BG = "43m";
const BLUE_BG = "44m";
const MAGENTA_BG = "45m";
const CYAN_BG = "46m";
const WHITE_BG = "47m";
const BRIGHT_BLACK_BG = "100m";
const BRIGHT_RED_BG = "101m";
const BRIGHT_GREEN_BG = "102m";
const BRIGHT_YELLOW_BG = "103m";
const BRIGHT_BLUE_BG = "104m";
const BRIGHT_MAGENTA_BG = "105m";
const BRIGHT_CYAN_BG = "106m";
const BRIGHT_WHITE_BG = "107m";


Example: 

console.printf("{s}{s}Colored Text{s}", .{ CSI, RED, RESET });
                                                ^^^
                                                This turns the color of the text red. (duh)
                                                Also, when dealing with colors, you need to put "console.printf" instead of "console.puts" (for some reason, idk, ask HPsaucii.)
